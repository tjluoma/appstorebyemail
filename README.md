## The Problem:

You are on your iPhone or iPad and you hear about this cool new Mac App Store app, so you google it, click the linkâ€¦ and find yourself staring at a page that tells you that you can only see Mac App Store apps on a Mac.

*Or* you're on your iPhone and hear about a cool new iPad app, but it's iPad-only, and so you can't see anything about it either.


## The Solution:

Take that link, email it to yourself, have your Mac do some computational 'magic' and send you back a nice HTML email showing you information from the Mac App Store (or iOS App Store).

## Warning:

This isn't something you can just drop in to your system and have it work. Expect to take some time to configure things on your end.

However, once you have it up and running, it only takes about a minute from the time I send the email until the time I get the response.

(It even works if you get one of those ugly Google.com search result links which wants to redirect you before taking you to the Mac App Store page.)

## This Is What You Will Need:

1. A Mac, which has Mail.app running on it and which will automatically fetch and process your email.

2. `multimarkdown` and `lynx` and `msmtp` which you can get via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

3. `html2text.py` which you can get from <https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text/downloads>



## There is another alternative!

I have also done this using [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel), [Drafts for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8), and Dropbox. It still requires a Mac for processing, but it does not require that Mail.app be running. If you're interested in that, let me know. (I plan to put it on Github too but haven't yet.)

## Setup (an overview)

1. Install msmtp and configure it. I wrote a [how-to  at TUAW.com](http://www.tuaw.com/2010/05/04/msmtp-a-free-tool-to-send-email-from-terminal/). It should take less than 30 minutes if you already have Homebrew installed. Maybe 10 if you're quick.

2. Install `multimarkdown` and `lynx` too.

3. Install [html2text.py](https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text/downloads) somewhere in your $PATH

4. Move mail-reply-with-mas-info.sh to somewhere like /usr/local/bin/ (if you move it somewhere else you'll need to edit `Mail-App-Reply-With-MAS-Info.scpt` to tell it where to find it.

4. Move the `Mail-App-Reply-With-MAS-Info.scpt` file to ~/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail/

5. Configure a Mail.app rule to trigger Mail-App-Reply-With-MAS-Info.scpt when the right criteria are met.


5. Move `basic-clean-reformat.rc` to `/usr/local/etc/tidy/basic-clean-reformat.rc`

6. In `mail-reply-with-mas-info.sh` you'll need to:   
	* verify HTML_TIDY is pointing to wherever you saved  `basic-clean-reformat.rc`
	* set your PATH
	* set the DIR variable (where do you want files saved?)
	* (All 3 of those are right at the top)
